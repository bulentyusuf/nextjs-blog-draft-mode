/**
 * `className` appends, it does not merge — clsx concatenates and knows nothing
 * about Tailwind, so an override lands beside the default rather than replacing
 * it, and the winner is decided by source order in the generated stylesheet.
 * Tailwind emits utilities in ascending value order, so a spacing override can
 * only ever INCREASE a value: a smaller one silently loses.
 *
 * That is why the top inset is a prop rather than a class. Browse pages sit
 * under a full-bleed band that has already drawn the boundary, so they need
 * LESS space above their content than a bare page does, and `className` cannot
 * express that. app/browse-page.tsx sets the browse rhythm; nothing else passes
 * this.
