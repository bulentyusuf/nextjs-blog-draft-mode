/**
 * The shell every taxonomy listing shares — a category, tag or author page, in
 * either its paginated or its unpaginated form.
 *
 * Those six routes rendered the same tree with the same props and differed only
 * in their `<header>`: a plain heading for a category or tag, a heading beside a
 * portrait for an author. So the header is `children` rather than a set of
 * props. Passing `name`, `description` and `avatar` and reassembling them here
 * would mean a conditional per difference, which is how a shared component
 * becomes harder to read than the six copies it replaced.
 *
 * What is genuinely uniform lives here: the band, the position caption, the
 * listing itself, the pager, and the empty state.
 *
 * `children` is therefore purely editorial — a heading and a standfirst, nothing
 * navigational. The "Page N of M" caption is rendered here rather than passed
 * in, because it belongs to the list and this component already holds the two
 * numbers. PageContext returns null on page 1, so it is rendered unconditionally
 * and no route decides whether its own page counts as paginated.
 *
 * The position caption goes into the band as its last line rather than into
 * the flow above the list — app/page-context.tsx carries why. It is rendered
 * here rather than passed in, because this component already holds both
 * numbers and PageContext returns null on page 1, so no route decides whether
 * its own page counts as paginated.
