// The typography plugin measures the prose column in `ch`, which is keyed to
// the current font's zero glyph, so the column silently resizes whenever the
// body face changes — Inter's zero is 0.6309em against Literata's 0.5790em, an
// 8% narrowing with no width anywhere in the diff. The measure lives on the
// max-w-2xl parents instead. If this override is removed, the column starts
// drifting with the font again and nothing else will notice.
