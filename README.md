# Be Useful.

The source for [bulentyusuf.com](https://bulentyusuf.com), a personal blog about content, code, and making things with generative AI.

## About

A small, statically generated blog. Posts are written and managed in a headless CMS, rendered by Next.js, and deployed continuously. The content model is deliberately compact, a Post type backed by Author and Category, with a Code Block type for embedded snippets, a Prompt Block type for publishing the image prompt behind a cover, and a Page type for standalone pages like the privacy notice.

A recurring subject of the blog is the process of building and maintaining it. Much of the codebase has been developed in collaboration with [Claude](https://claude.ai), and several posts document what that's actually like in practice. The visual identity uses editorial-style cover images generated with [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com).

## Stack

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)** (App Router), rendering and routing
- **[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com)**, headless CMS queried over GraphQL, with draft mode and live preview
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)**, styling
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)**, hosting and deployment
- **TypeScript** throughout

## Content model

- **Post**, the main entry type. Title, slug, publish and updated dates, cover image, excerpt, rich-text body, and links to one author and one category
- **Author**, name, picture, slug, and a short bio, with its own landing page
- **Category**, name, slug, description, and thumbnail, with its own landing page. Posts are filed under Main Quest or Side Quests
- **Code Block**, embedded into post bodies for syntax-highlighted snippets. Optional filename and a fixed list of languages
- **Prompt Block**, embedded into post bodies to publish the generative-image prompt behind a cover, with an optional label and image
- **Page**, standalone rich-text pages such as About and Privacy

## Features

- Static generation with on-demand revalidation. Content edits in the CMS go live immediately via a webhook, without a full redeploy
- Draft mode and live preview for editing posts before publishing
- Paginated home, category, and author listings
- Category and author landing pages, each with a directory index
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks with a copy button, powered by Shiki
- Per-post table of contents and an image lightbox
- Auto-generated sitemap, `robots.txt`, and RSS feed
- Open Graph and Twitter card metadata for shareable links
- Security-reviewed, with branch protection, CodeQL scanning, and dependency monitoring

## Getting started

This repository works as a template. Fork it, point it at your own Contentful space, and deploy your own version. It is MIT licensed.

### Prerequisites

- Node 20 or newer
- A Contentful account with an empty space
- Optionally, a Vercel account for hosting

### 1. Install

```
git clone https://github.com/bulentyusuf/nextjs-blog-draft-mode.git
cd nextjs-blog-draft-mode
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Copy the example file and fill in the values.

```
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

- `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID`, your space ID, under Settings then General settings in Contentful
- `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, a Content Delivery API token from Settings then API keys
- `CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN`, the Content Preview API token from the same API keys page
- `CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_SECRET`, any random string you choose, it guards the draft preview route
- `CONTENTFUL_REVALIDATE_SECRET`, any random string you choose, it guards the revalidation webhook
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, your public site URL such as `https://example.com`, used for canonical links, Open Graph tags, the sitemap, and the RSS feed

### 3. Import the content model

This creates the content types and locales in your space from `contentful/export.json`. It needs a Contentful Management token, which is different from the delivery and preview tokens above. It is passed only on the command line and never committed.

```
npm run import:contentful -- --space-id YOUR_SPACE_ID --management-token YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN
```

### 4. Add example content (optional)

Seeds a few placeholder posts, authors, categories, and pages, all published, so the site renders straight away.

```
npm run import:seed -- --space-id YOUR_SPACE_ID --management-token YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN
```

The seed ships a single placeholder image, reused for every cover, avatar, and thumbnail. This keeps the import light and free of bundled media. Replace it and the dummy text with your own once you are set up.

### 5. Run locally

```
npm run dev
```

The site runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 6. Deploy

Push to GitHub and import the repository into Vercel, then set the same environment variables in the Vercel project settings.

### 7. Live updates and preview

A deployed build is static, so by default a published edit will not appear on the live site until the next deploy. The revalidation webhook is what makes edits go live on their own, and skipping it is the most common reason a fresh deploy shows stale content. Worth setting up.

**Revalidation.** In your space, go to Settings then Webhooks and add a webhook:

- URL `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/revalidate`, method `POST`
- Add a custom header `x-vercel-reval-key` with the value of your `CONTENTFUL_REVALIDATE_SECRET`
- Under triggers, select publish and unpublish for both Entry and Asset
- If your space has more than one environment, filter to `master` so staging edits do not revalidate production

Once it is live, publishing in Contentful refreshes the affected pages within seconds with no redeploy. Full reference in Contentful's docs at https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/webhooks/configure-webhook/

**Preview.** Set the Post type's content preview URL to
`https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/draft?secret=YOUR_PREVIEW_SECRET&slug={entry.fields.slug}`. Editors can then open a draft in place.

## Make it yours

Forking this template carries over the original author's specifics. Change these before you deploy:

- **Site URL (required).** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your own domain in `.env.local` and in your host. Without it the canonical links, sitemap, OG tags, and RSS fall back to a localhost URL.
- **Site identity.** Edit `SITE_TITLE`, `SITE_DESCRIPTION`, `SITE_AUTHOR`, and `SITE_REPO_URL` in `lib/constants.ts`.
- **llms.txt.** `public/llms.txt` is a hand-written file describing the original site. Replace it with your own, or delete it.
- **Brand assets.** Replace the Open Graph image `public/be_useful.jpg`, swap the favicon and app icon, and retune the palette tokens and `themeColor` in `app/globals.css` and `app/layout.tsx` if you want a different look.
- **Seed images (optional).** If you re-run the seed, repoint `PLACEHOLDER_ASSET_URL` in `contentful/build-seed.mjs` to your own copy, then replace the placeholder cover, avatar, and thumbnail with real assets afterwards.
- **CLAUDE.md (optional).** Useful as-is for working with Claude Code on the repo. Review it for any notes specific to the original author.

## Troubleshooting

**Edited content not showing on the deployed site?** Check two things. First, the entry is Published, not just saved, since the live site reads published content only. Second, the revalidation webhook above is set up, because without it static pages serve build-time content until the next deploy. Quick test, trigger a redeploy in Vercel. If the change then appears, the webhook is the missing piece.
