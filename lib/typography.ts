 * Firefox and older Safari still orphan the last word — this is deterministic
 * and works in every browser. A no-op below three words.
 *
 * Use on short display strings (titles and headings), not on body prose: it
 * only protects the very last line, and gluing two long words can force a wide
 * last line in a narrow column.

  // column rather than wrapping badly. At the wide h1 ramp two long words run
  // to roughly 690px, which fits at 100% zoom and overflows at 120% on a
  // narrow viewport. "Information Architecture" is the tag page that reported
  // it, and every other two-word tag, category and author name was one
  // character away from the same thing.
  //
  // A count rather than a measurement, because the failure is structural. The
  // string has no line for a lone word to fall onto, so the guard does not
  // need to know how wide anything renders. The cost is that a two-token title
  // ending in a parenthesised year, "Mindbenders (1988)", no longer binds it.
  // A widow is cosmetic and an overflow is not, so that trade is deliberate.

  // We deliberately do NOT glue a third token: binding three words forces a
  // long, unbalanced last line in a narrow column, which looks worse than the
  // single widow it was meant to cure.
