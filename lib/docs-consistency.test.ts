// CLAUDE.md, README.md and public/llms.txt carry a lot of prose about how the
// repo works, and prose is the only artefact here with no verification path:
// code has tsc, formatting has Prettier, behaviour has vitest, the two
// Contentful spaces have contentful-fixtures.test.ts. These checks cover the
// part of the prose that is mechanically checkable — the names of things.
//
// They deliberately do NOT try to verify claims. A sentence can name a real
// file and still describe it wrongly; only a reader catches that. What they
// stop is the cheaper failure: a rename or a removal quietly turning an
// instruction into a dead end.
