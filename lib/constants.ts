// Resolution order, most specific first.
//
// 1. NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL, the explicit setting. Needed for a custom domain and
//    the only one of the three that survives moving off Vercel.
// 2. VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL, so a fork deployed without step 1 emits its
//    real domain rather than localhost. Vercel sets this at both build and
//    runtime, and always to the production domain even inside a preview
//    deployment, which is what canonicals and feed links want. VERCEL_URL is
//    deliberately not used: it is per-deployment, so it would change canonicals
//    on every push, and it is unreachable when Standard Deployment Protection
//    is enabled.
// 3. localhost, for `next dev`.
//
// Both sources go through normaliseOrigin, because a bare domain is the
// commonest way to set either by hand and Vercel documents its own production
// URL as scheme-less. Everything downstream feeds `new URL()`: metadataBase in
// app/layout.tsx throws outright on a scheme-less value, failing the build with
// an ERR_INVALID_URL that names neither the variable nor the setting, and
// parseHostname below swallows that same error and silently yields "localhost",
// which then lands in AUTHOR_EMAIL.

// Trailing slashes are stripped because every consumer appends its own path, so
// `https://example.com/` would otherwise emit `https://example.com//posts/x`
// into the sitemap and the feed. An existing scheme is preserved rather than
// forced to https, so an explicit `http://localhost:3000` keeps working.
