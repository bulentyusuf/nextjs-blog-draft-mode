// PARAGRAPH: its paragraphs would render as <p>, and a <p> start tag closes an
// open paragraph in the parser exactly as <details> did, so the default renderer
// would reintroduce that bug from inside the note. Render them as spans blocked
// out in CSS instead. The content type enables only bold, italic and hyperlink,
// so paragraphs are the only block node a note can carry.
//
// HYPERLINK: the shared renderer, so a link in a note gets the same URL-scheme
// allowlisting, external-link treatment and new-window hint as a link in the
// post body. The default renderer emits data.uri as-is, which would let a
// javascript: href through here while the body rejected it.

// A Tufte-style sidenote, rendered inline at its reference point.
//
// Two constraints shape this markup, and both are easy to undo by accident.
//
// 1. Every element is phrasing content: <span>, <sup>, <input>, <label>. An
//    earlier <details> version was not, and the HTML parser implicitly closes an
//    open paragraph on a <details> start tag, which split sentences mid-line and
//    desynced React's tree from the parsed DOM. Do not introduce <details>,
//    <summary> or <p> here; `display: inline` cannot undo a parse-time split.
//
// 2. Below 2xl the note opens with no JavaScript. The toggle is a visually
//    hidden checkbox driving `:checked ~ .sidenote-body` in CSS, not a button
//    driving React state, so a note is readable with scripts off and before
//    hydration — notes are content, and content should not need JS. That is
//    also why this is a server component with no "use client": the feature
//    ships zero client JavaScript. The cost, accepted deliberately, is that the
//    control announces as a checkbox rather than carrying aria-expanded.
//
// The note is DOM-adjacent to its reference, so a screen reader reads it where
// it is referenced at every viewport; CSS float never reorders the tree.
//
// Responsive behaviour lives entirely in the .sidenote-* rules in globals.css.
// Do not add Tailwind display utilities to these elements. Those rules are
// unlayered and outrank anything in the utilities layer, so a `2xl:hidden` here
// silently loses — that is what previously left both markers visible at 2xl.
//
// The visible reference number here (`number`, a document-order index computed
// in rich-text.tsx) and the "N. " prefix on the floated note (a CSS counter in
// globals.css) are two views of the same count. Both advance once per sidenote
// in document order, so they always agree; keep them in step if either moves.
